      <li> pre-trained models/weights cannot be used since the architectures has been trained for specific input configurations: images. Moreover they are also used for feature extraction, which is already been done.</li>
      <li> Tried out 2 Models</li>
      <li> Using pre-trained models/weights to improve accuracy</li>
      <li> Try out another Model: MHA Cocatenate MHA & using a parallel process </li>

      <li> see results in Overview</li>
  <h2> TO-DO </h2>
      <li> Train on dataset Y, Test on dataset X across all datasets</li>
      <li> Combine all datasets and train on all datasets</li>
