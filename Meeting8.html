      <li> I presented my implementation of Transformer into my Model. The results show a worse performance of 20% -18% across all datasets. 
        This is because the model overfits and with the transformer the model is too complex for the data.

      <li> Talked about the Feature extraction of the three Modalities. Working on text modality with gloves, 
        Audio modality with Covarep and Visual modality with Openface  </li>
