### List of papers 
(ordered based on the year of publication), Publication year, Publisher name, paper title [Link to the paper], [link to the codes, if existing]

### List of datasets 

- Publication year, Dataset name [Link to the dataset page], Give a short summary of the dataset using bulletin(i.e., image-based?video?sound?the number of       samples? the annotation labels? the number of frames? the volume of the dataset?...)
### Evaluation metrics (introduce the links to the materials that explain these metrics. They could be papers, tutorials, or webpage)
### Useful links (name any useful tutorial/webpage/paper that is useful in your opinion)




# Some searching tip
- Use different keywords (if you read the introduction of the several first papers, you can find suitable keywords to find the other papers)
- Use a combination of keywords (deep learning + personality perception; survey + sentimental analysis; ...)
- See the list of papers that have cited the well-known datasets. There is a ''Cited by ...'' link in google scholar below each paper item. That link shows the papers that have been cited, let's say, the well-known dataset paper.
- This website (https://paperswithcode.com/) may help you to find some papers with their codes and gives you an overview of the performance of the recent works on different datasets for different evaluation metrics.
